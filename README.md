## SmartDesk

SmartDesk is a web application developed using the Django framework. It provides user authentication and enables users to create and join rooms where they can interact with other users who share similar interests in technology. This project aims to create a platform that fosters collaboration and knowledge sharing within the student community.

## Features

**User Authentication:** SmartDesk includes a robust user authentication system, allowing users to register, log in, and manage their profiles.

**Room Creation:** Users have the ability to create their own rooms based on their interests and topics of discussion. Each room represents a specific area of technology or a particular subject.

**Room Participation:** Users can join existing rooms created by other users. They can browse through the list of available rooms, view the discussions, and decide which rooms they want to be a part of.

**Commenting:** Once a user has joined a room, they can actively participate in discussions by commenting on the existing posts. Users can share their thoughts, ask questions, or provide answers related to the topics being discussed in the room.

**Engagement and Collaboration:** SmartDesk encourages active engagement and collaboration among users. By providing a platform for students with similar technology interests to connect, it facilitates the exchange of ideas, knowledge sharing, and networking.
